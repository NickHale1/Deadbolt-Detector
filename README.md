## Introduction 

The Costello Deadbolt Detector is an application designed to improve daily security for the user. The patent is a non-intrusive home security device that delivers optimal security functionality by working with your IOS device to detect if the door has been locked. The idea is a door sensor that would be linked to the location of the phone. Once the user leaves the apartments designated geolocation, a sensor will determine if the door is locked or unlocked; if left unlocked it will notify the user phone after a certain interval of time. This will also be sensitive to multiple users in a network. If one user leaves the location and leaves the door unlocked, but there is still another user (roommate) in the designated location, the application will not keep notifying the travelling persons. 






## Functions/Features 

- Login authentication/Secure User data Storage (Brendan) 

- Account Management (Nick) 

- IOS app notifications when leaving or when the lock is updated (Nick) 

- Raspberry pi reports status of lock (Brendan) 

## Technologies and Tools 

### Technologies 

XCode 

Best IDE for native IOS development. We have access to an M1 MacBook which will allow us to develop for the Apple platform 

Raspbian/Raspberry pi 4 

Raspberry pi will be used in tandem with python to measure the distance between the sensors and the deadbolt to tell if the door is locked or not 

Proximity Sensor 

Proximity sensor will be used in tandem with the Raspberry Pi to measure the distance of the deadbolt and ping the phone if left unlocked 




### Tools 

GitHub – Version control  

Google Drawings – designing UI 

GitHub issues – Task tracking
